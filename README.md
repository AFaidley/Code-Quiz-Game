# Code-Quiz-Game

## Description

I created a short Javascript quiz to test the knowledge of the user on their Javascript basics. This quiz will let the user compare their knowledge with others who choose to use the save highscore function and submit their scores.

Here is a link to my deployed application:
https://afaidley.github.io/Code-Quiz-Game/

## Usage

Upon entering the homepage the user will be greeted with two clickable buttons, one being the start and the other being the view highscores button. If the user clicks on the view highscore button, the user will be able to view any saved highscores as well as clear the highscores. When the user is ready to start the game they can click on the start button, at which point the timer will start and they will be presented with questions. If they select an an incorrect answer 10 seconds will be deducted from the time- please be mindful that the final time left will be the highscore. At the end of the quiz, whether it is from them completing all questions or the time running out, they will  be preseneted with the option to insert therir initials and save their higscore. From the higscore page they can navigate back to the homepage via the home button and re-try the quiz if they please.
Thank you for using my app!
